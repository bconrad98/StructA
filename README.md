# StructA HW 3
## How to run the code
1. Make sure numpy is installed
    - `pip install numpy`
2. In command line, run `python main.py test_input_hw3`
    - **input_hw4** - this argument is the path to the directory that contains input files
    - since I have a folder with the input files in the same directory as main.py, then the path relative to the location of main.py is just the name of the folder 
3. **NOTE:** Input files **have** to be named as follows:
    - nodes.txt
    - displacements.txt
    - forces.txt
    - elements.txt
