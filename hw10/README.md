# StructA HW 3
## How to run the code
1. Make sure dependencies are installed
    - `pip install numpy`
    - `pip install scipy`
    - `pip install matplotlib`
2. In command line, run `python main.py input_hw10/x`
    - **input_hw10/x** - this argument is the path to the directory that contains input files, where x is either R, 6, 12, or 24. x represents another directory that contains more specific files. 
3. **NOTE:** Input files **have** to be named as follows:
    - nodesx.txt
    - displacementsx.txt
    - forcesx.txt
    - elementsx.txt
    + Again: **x is either R, 6, 12, or 24**
4. This program will automatically save plotted figures to the directory that main.py is run in. They are .png extensions and can be opened and viewed once the program is done.
